What is CSS

CSS want to separate format and content. 

How do you identify an element? (all with a name, all with a class, the one with a unique id, and a relationship)

Can do layout without tables!

CSS3 - many documents 

3 ways to specify:
1) HTML Style attribute
2) Style element
3) Link element inside head element in html (external)

CSS rules

selector-list { property list } 

Can only have one element with a given id???

Selectors: Descendents (context) or direct children with > 

the Box model

Content (padding) Border (margin) for all 4 sides!

a:first-letter, :hover (pseudo class)

/// Now CSS3!

Current browsers: some features unsupported, others experimental.

http://caniuse.com
http://thebookofcss3.com/resources

Experimental: means you need a vendor specific prefix to use the property:

-ms-  for IE
-moz- for Firefox
-o- for Opera
-webkit- for Safari/Chrome

And then need the generic property name for when you need to get rid of the experimental!

Cool features of CSS3:

Media Queries!
- Detect what size of browser you are on, and flex based on that
http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-mediaqueries

Fonts Level 3!
http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-css3-fonts-20110324/ (working draft 24 March 2011).
Dynamically get a different font file
Can add shadows to text, and can have multiple shadows

Letterbox and text strokes

Multi-column Layout!!!!
* Can pick how many columns there should be
* or give fixed width for columns
* specify size and spacing of lines

Backgrounds and borders!!!!
* multiple backgrounds
* Rounded corners 
* Border/box shadows

Image Values and Replaced Content!
* Gradients and many other features
** Can have multiple gradients on a box

FlexBox!
* In a lot of flux currently (Warning on property changes)
*** specify elements that are grouped together (in rows and columns)
*** and can specify groups and assign numbers as to how much space should it take up?
*** Can do rows and columns. 
** Can take text and center it in a box! (hard to do in css 2, when multiple lines)

Transitions!
** If change property, takes time to move from one to another
** Transforms Take 2 seconds to get there, and control of timing function

2D Transforms!
* translation, rotation, scaling

3D Transforms!
(webkit & ff? not tested in IE)
* play with z axis!
* hover / click are pseudo elements
* Can use javascript
* Translated along Z axis


!!!SASS - 
Syntatically Awesome Style Sheets

Implemented as ruby, but don't need to know ruby
Requires ruby to run

Features: 
variables - no repeating
nesting - avoids repeating selectors
Mixins
selector inheritance

http://sass-lang.com/

sass -v -> get version

Errors in input in css
Link to generated .css files not .scss files

sass syntax (original, concise, similar to python with indentation (.sass)
scss syntax ("Sassy CSS", extension of CSS3 syntax, extension .scss, preferred)

sass uses file extension to determine syntax used.

nesting used to not repeat groups. 

sass:
#main
    color: blue
    font-size: 18pt
    a
        font:
            weight: bold
            Family: serif
    &:hover
        font-color:red

sass-convert can change between tht two


style option, styles the css output

logically nested (default) nested
expanded, compact, compressed

**Sass watch option

watch a sass directory and generate css

sass --watch <sass dir>:<css dir>

Sass supports comments /* */ (carries through) but also // (stripped out)

Almost a Whole programming language
- Can have values, and can compute property values, and use interpolation. dynamically generate

conditional logic, loops, debugging / functions

-Variables $name

Assigned like properties $name: value  (inside a rule, or global for a stylesheet)

math functions

$halfWidth: $width/2 - $padding - $borderWidth/2;

-Interpolation
Used to compute selectors, propertyNames, propertyValues
Generate #{expression}

- Data Types
Boolean / number (with units, if they can be compared!!!) / String / Color / List

- Functions (color: invert, compliment, mix... call a function, positional or keyword)

- Import sass files into others. (functions and definitions)

- Selector Inheritance. 

extend .warning

- @mixin name(with parameters, default values), lets you have multiple to not have to specify vendor specific rules each time. 

- Custom functons -> generate single value versus mixin generates multiple lines of CSS


Recommendations!
- Rename .css to .scss
- Over time replace each 
- Use compass mixins for setting common sets of properties
   -- compass on top of sass with mixins... 
   -- property css reset (helps pages look the same in every browser
   -- blueprint layout
